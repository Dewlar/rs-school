## transcript

That's me and my life. But let's stop and talk about everything in order.
Hi, my name is Andrew, but you can call me Andrew because it's easier to pronounce and closer for a native speaker. Today I'm going to talk about myself, my experience and my life. And so let's get started.

My introduction to programming started in high school. We studied Pascal. When I saw it for the first time, I was very impressed and even then I decided to become a developer.

I entered the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, on specialty "modeling and computer design of radio electronic means". But I was wrong. We studied one programming course on Delphi. After that, distributed to the factory of microelectronics, where I was finally convinced that it is not for me.

Well received medals at school, and diplomas did not help me.

I had to start over. So I finished the system administrator course. And started working as a systems engineer. I mastered networks, network communications, improved in the administration of Windows server. I configured firewalls, User gates and many other interesting things.

At the same time I entered BSUIR again. This time I studied C++ and C#. But after graduation, my real life brought a surprise and made adjustments again.

So now I'm here. After a few years, I decided to realize my dream and become a developer. I had experience, but no practice. RS-school is helping me with that. Here I realized that I like front-end, I like javascript. Rs-school is an awesome course. It helps to fill the gaps in my memory. Learn a lot of new things. Cross-checked and deadline driven assignments, simulates a work environment. It's very powerful.

You probably want to know what I do in life besides programming.
I love nature photography, here are a few of them. I like to drive a motorcycle. Snowboarding. And play guitar.

Thank you for your time. All the best.
