  Whoa whoa whoa, this is me and my life, but let's stop and talk about everything in order. Hi, my name is Andrew. Some
friends call me Andrew, it's easier for pronunciation neutiv-speakers. Let's get acquainted.  
I was born in a small town. I went to grammar school. I graduated with a silver medal. My introduction to programming
began with the center of additional education. Where we studied pascal and solved algorithmic problems and prepared for
Olympiads. I was very fascinated by it, and even then I decided to become a developer.  
I entered the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. On specialty Modeling and computer design
of radio-electronic means. There I got acquainted with Delphi programming language, but it was only the 1st course.
After graduating from the university, I was assigned to the factory of microelectronics, but this sphere did not attract
me.  
I finished the courses of System Administrator. And began to administer networks.
Parrallely I entered the university again, in IIT where I studied C++ and C#.
Now I realized that I want to do front-end development and become a cool developer.
I love photography, motorcycle riding, playing guitar, and snowboarding.
