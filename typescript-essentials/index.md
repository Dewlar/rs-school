## Reflections

 + I learned about the definition of typescript. The main feature of which is the type system. I learned how to install typescript and set up a code editor.
 + The advantage of typescript is that it allows you to add static types. In addition to the usual types in javascript, typescript has the `any` and `unknouwn` types. Learned about union types and intersection types (&)
 + I learned about the possibility of implementing interfaces to describe an object in a typescript. An interface can be used as a type and gain full type checking capabilities. Interfaces help you create shorthand names for commonly used types and provide a consistent set of objects because Every object that implements an interface works with the same type definitions.
 + I got acquainted with the functions of typescript and learned about possible ways to describe functions in typescript. Learned how named, anonymous and arrow functions are described.
 + Expanded knowledge of OOP. Practiced creating classes, extending them, and the capabilities that typescript provides. For example, I found out what access modifiers are. I learned about static properties, and that they are common to all instances of a class. Declare an interface to ensure class shape.
 + I learned about a new concept for me: generic type. This is a generic type template that provides greater flexibility when working with types. Helps create universal functions, interfaces, etc. which can work with different types, and at the same time tell the compiler the exact type we expect. This will help reduce the use of the any type and improve code reuse.
 + Learned how to organize code using typescript modules. I learned about the features of the typescript compiler when working with modules, namely that the compiled file does not have .js extensions
 + Learned about the ability to organize code using namespaces. Improved isolation of code sections. I found it convenient. But unfortunately it is recommended to use modules and not to use modules and namespace at the same time.
  
Overall, Typescript is a powerful language that improves code structure. Helps avoid errors by adding strong typing.
